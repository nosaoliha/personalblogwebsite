				<h2>Biography</h2>
					<p>Dr. Oludan has always loved fashion and wanted to do something <q>African fashion</q> related for the longest. Growing up under the wings of an African fashionista mother <em>(from Ghana and Nigeria)</em> carved the style crave in me from day one. Her bazaar of African print clothing always fascinated and inspired me. I grew up around them and today they are almost growing on everything around me.</p>
					<p>Aside from being aesthetic pieces of clothing in my life, African prints played a pivotal role in encouraging me on the path of being the confident woman I am today.</p>
					<p>She was born with a conspicuous red birthmark on the left side of my face. In Elementary school, kids often teased and bullied me verbally. They referred to her as a “Red face monster” or “Your-mother-must-have-slapped-you-with-a-red-spoon.” These negative remarks stabbed her self-worth to the point she believed she was truly a hideous monster. This ordeal became the genesis of her traumatic odyssey in the world of self-rejection and timidity.  she did not have a sense of belonging among her peers and felt all alone. </p>
					<p>Her darling mother, <em>(her inspiration, embodiment of strength and biggest cheerleader)</em> always encouraged and consoled her.  She repeatedly declared to her “You are going to be great,” “You are beautiful” and “You are somebody.” For the longest, she didn’t believe her – after all, she was her mother and wouldn’t tell her otherwise.</p>
